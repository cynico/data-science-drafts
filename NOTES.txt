In lasso and ridge regression models:

alpha corresponds to restriction.

Increasing alpha -> Increasing restriciton -> Moving towards a generalized model (The underfitting side) -> Increasing regularization.

Decreasing alpha -> Decreasing restriction ->
-> All the involved features will have considerable weight in our prediction. -> Moving towards an overfit model -> Decreasing regularization.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In LogisticRegression and LineSVC classification models (both of which use L2 regularization):

We use C.
C is practically the opposite of alpha.
Increasing C -> Decreasing regularization -> Moving towarads an overfit model.
